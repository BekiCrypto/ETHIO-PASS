## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2), symbolizing trust and technology. Its analogous nature means it evokes similar feelings as a typical choice like teal, while still distinguishing this app from other generic, trendy color schemes.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5F9), providing a clean and professional backdrop that lets key UI elements stand out, and complements the primary blue. At 10% saturation, the blue's background provides only a hint of the analogous color to the vibrant primary blue.
- Accent color: Green (#8CC63F), used for calls to action and success indicators, giving a clear, contrasting guide to the user within the user interface. Because this color is 30 degrees 'left' of the primary on the color wheel, it can still be considered within an analogous scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that provides a clean, modern, objective appearance, appropriate for both headlines and body text. 'Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.'
- Use clear, modern icons to represent different identity verification steps and data points.
- Clean, modular layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation. Use of whitespace to create a sense of trust and professionalism.
